A service that orchestrates Helm chart installations for the OpenFrame CLI, handling the complete workflow from configuration through deployment with support for both interactive and CI/CD modes.

## Key Components

- **ChartService**: Main service struct that manages chart operations with Kubernetes integration
- **NewChartService**: Constructor that initializes the service with immediate HelmManager setup
- **NewChartServiceDeferred**: Constructor for delayed HelmManager initialization after cluster selection
- **Install/InstallWithContext**: Primary installation methods supporting cancellation contexts
- **InstallationWorkflow**: Orchestrates the multi-step installation process with signal handling
- **ExecuteWithContext**: Workflow execution with context support and graceful cancellation

## Usage Example

```go
// Create chart service with immediate initialization
kubeConfig := &rest.Config{Host: "https://cluster.local"}
chartService, err := NewChartService(kubeConfig, false, true)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Install a chart with context
req := utilTypes.InstallationRequest{
    DeploymentMode:  "production",
    NonInteractive:  false,
    DryRun:         false,
    Verbose:        true,
    Args:           []string{"my-cluster"},
}

ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

if err := chartService.InstallWithContext(ctx, req); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Installation failed: %v", err)
}
```

The service supports three installation modes: fully interactive (wizard-driven), partially non-interactive (pre-selected deployment mode), and fully non-interactive (CI/CD). It includes comprehensive error handling, signal interruption support, and automatic cleanup of temporary files.
