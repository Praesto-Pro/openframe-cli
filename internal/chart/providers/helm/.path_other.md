A platform-specific file that provides a no-op implementation of path expansion functionality for non-Windows operating systems.

## Key Components

- **expandShortPath()** - A no-op function that returns the input path unchanged on non-Windows platforms

## Usage Example

```go
// On Linux, macOS, and other non-Windows systems
path := "/home/user/my-chart"
expanded, err := expandShortPath(path)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(expanded) // Output: "/home/user/my-chart" (unchanged)
```

This file uses Go's build constraint `//go:build !windows` to ensure it's only compiled on non-Windows platforms. It provides a stub implementation of `expandShortPath` that simply returns the input path without modification, since Windows-specific short filename (8.3 format) expansion is not needed on Unix-like systems. The corresponding Windows implementation would handle actual path expansion logic for DOS-style short filenames.
