This file provides ArgoCD application monitoring and synchronization logic for OpenFrame CLI deployments.

## Key Components

- **WaitForApplications()** - Main function that waits for all ArgoCD applications to reach Healthy and Synced status
- **Context Management** - Handles cancellation signals, timeouts, and graceful shutdown via signal handlers
- **Health Monitoring** - Periodic cluster connectivity checks and resource monitoring during bootstrap and main phases
- **Progress Tracking** - Visual spinner with timer and verbose logging for application synchronization progress
- **Recovery Logic** - WSL-specific recovery mechanisms and repo-server issue detection/recovery
- **Timeout Handling** - 60-minute timeout with early exit conditions for dry-run mode and cancelled contexts

## Usage Example

```go
// Initialize ArgoCD manager
manager := &Manager{
    clusterName: "my-cluster",
}

// Configure installation
config := config.ChartInstallConfig{
    ClusterName: "my-cluster",
    Verbose:     true,
    DryRun:      false,
    Silent:      false,
    SkipCRDs:    false,
}

// Wait for applications with context timeout
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 60*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

// Monitor ArgoCD application synchronization
err := manager.WaitForApplications(ctx, config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to wait for ArgoCD applications: %v", err)
}
```

The function includes comprehensive error handling for cluster connectivity issues, WSL recovery on Windows systems, and graceful handling of interrupt signals during long-running synchronization operations.
