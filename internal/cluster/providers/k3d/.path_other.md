A platform-specific file that provides a no-op implementation of short path expansion for non-Windows operating systems, where Windows 8.3 filename format handling is not required.

## Key Components

- **expandShortPath()** - Returns the input path unchanged on non-Windows platforms, providing a consistent interface across operating systems

## Usage Example

```go
// This function is called internally by other k3d components
// On non-Windows systems, it simply returns the original path
expandedPath, err := expandShortPath("/usr/local/bin/k3d")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// expandedPath == "/usr/local/bin/k3d" (unchanged)
```

This file uses Go's build constraint `//go:build !windows` to ensure it's only compiled on non-Windows platforms. The Windows-specific implementation would be in a separate file with the `//go:build windows` constraint, providing the actual short path expansion logic using Windows APIs.
